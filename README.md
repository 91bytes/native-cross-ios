# Hotwire Native for iOS

**Build high-fidelity hybrid apps with native navigation and a single shared web view.** Hotwire Native for iOS provides the tooling to wrap your [Turbo 7](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo)-enabled web app in a native iOS shell. It manages a single WKWebView instance across multiple view controllers, giving you native navigation UI with all the client-side performance benefits of Turbo.

- **Deliver fast, efficient hybrid apps.** Avoid reloading JavaScript and CSS. Save memory by sharing one WKWebView.
- **Reuse mobile web views across platforms.** Create your views once, on the server, in HTML. Deploy them to iOS, [Android](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android), and mobile browsers simultaneously. Ship new features without waiting on App Store approval.
- **Enhance web views with native UI.** Navigate web views using native patterns. Augment web UI with native controls.
- **Produce large apps with small teams.** Achieve baseline HTML coverage for free. Upgrade to native views as needed.
